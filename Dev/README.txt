This folder contains the software you need to develop and test your solution.
It contains the following items:
	test2.sh	---> the script that executes the final test of your solution
	makezip.sh	---> the script that makes the zip to be submitted
	README.txt	---> this file

You need to use the same lab2.3 folder that you already used for Lab 2.
In order to setup the environment for this exercise, copy test2.sh and makezip.sh to folder lab2.3 and, inside lab2.3/source, create a new directory named server2 (it will be a sibling of server1 and client1).
In order to launch the tests, use the following command from lab2.3:
./test2.sh
The script compiles your solution (with the commands described in the assignment) and runs the tests.
In order to produce the zip file to be submitted, use the following command from lab2.3:
./makezip.sh
The script will produce a zip file named lab_2.3_3.1.zip. Check that it contains all the files of youir solutions (both 2.3 and 3.1).

Enjoy your work!
