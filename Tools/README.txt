This folder contains all the software you need to develop and test your solution.
It contains the following items:
	tools/		---> contains software utilities that are used by the testing script
	source/		---> write here the sources of your solutions
	test.sh		---> the script that executes the final test of your solution
	README.txt	---> this file

In order to launch the tests, use the following command:
./test.sh
The script compiles your solution (with the commands described in the assignment) and runs the tests.
DO NOT remove files from the skeleton provided (source folder).

Enjoy your work!
